# ML_for_tephrochronology
This is a Python code written mostly by Fatih Kıyıkçı to be submitted with the accompanied manuscript (Uslular et al.) to the Computers and Geosciences.

Here our aim is to predict the possible volcanic sources of unknown tephras (sort of a volcanic material formed by explosive volcanic activities) from the Eastern Mediterranean region. The code includes 10 different machine learning algorithms implemented to train the unbalanced geochemical dataset including the whole-rock and glass compositions of volcanics from South Aegean Active Volcanic Arc. The code can easily be used for further studies by predicting a new dataset (replace the excel file in row280) and/or updating the available traning dataset (replace the excel file in row279) based on the recent published works on that issue. In our preprinted manuscript, we present the advantages of machine-learning algorithms that can easily be implemented to predict volcanic sources, but we also like to express that the machine-learning can not be an automatized decision maker for the prediction of volcanic sources that certainly need many geological corroborations (e.g., age data) before deciding which candidate would be the best one.
